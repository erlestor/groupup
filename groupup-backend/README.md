To run our backend open the groupup-backend folder in the terminal and enter: "npm i && npm start"

## Testing

Our backend tests are written in the testing framework [cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/).

To run backend tests run `cd groupup-backend` in terminal. Run `npm install` to install all packages, and then run `npx cypress open` to open cypress. Run the tests by clicking them individually, or run all of them by clicking the `Run integration tests` button in the upper right corner.
